            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Focussing on the experiences and perceptions of parents and volunteer caregivers of children with disabilities, this paper reports on a study that explored the provision of early childhood development and inclusive education for children with disabilities in rural Malawi. Drawing on a community-based participatory research (CBPR) design, ten local community researchers and two Malawian researchers collaborated to interview forty caregivers and parents of children with disabilities attending ten Community Based Care Centres (CBCCS) in Southern Malawi. Findings are reported through four key themes: experiences of disability, inclusion, learning and developmental progress; factors influencing non-enrolment and absenteeism; barriers to learning and progress; and accountability and support channels. </p>
